    <h1>When I Grow Up</h1>

    <p>When I grow up, I want to be free.<br>
    I want to look at the stars and wish it were me,<br>
    To dance in the rain, let the cold kiss my skin,<br>
    Or be a pilot, slicing through clouds.</p>

    <p>I hope I can still say “when I grow up,”<br>
    Even when I’m already grown.</p>

    <p>I look back at my life—<br>
    A graveyard of dreams,<br>
    A barren land, infested with doubts.</p>

    <p>What will people say?<br>
    How would I look?<br>
    If only I knew,<br>
    There was nothing I could lose.</p>

    <p>Is it too late to say “when I grow up?”</p>

    <p>Maybe I should go back to painting<br>
    And dream of Van Gogh,<br>
    Or step into the past,<br>
    Barefoot in the sand,<br>
    Building castles that crumble with the tide.</p>

    <p>But now I am grown,<br>
    Crafting castles in air,<br>
    And the only thing I can do<br>
    Is dream of what could have been.</p>
