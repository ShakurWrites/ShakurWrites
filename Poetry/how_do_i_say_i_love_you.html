    <h1>How Do I Say I Love You</h1>

    <p>How do I say I love you, without saying I love you?<br>
    Hey you, I’m sorry—<br>
    Hey again, I’m drowning.<br>
    Thoughts of you consume me,<br>
    pulling me under.<br>
    All I’d give to find the safety<br>
    of the shore,<br>
    but how can I swim away<br>
    from the one thing keeping me alive?<br>
    So I let it sink me—<br>
    An anchor tied to my feet.<br>
    How do I say I love you,<br>
    Without saying I love you?</p>

    <p>“Never meet your heroes,” they say.<br>
    But I met you,<br>
    And now I’m stuck,<br>
    A moth to a flame,<br>
    A halo that weighs a ton.<br>
    You make my knees weak,<br>
    But for you, I’d run a thousand miles,<br>
    Barefoot through broken glass,<br>
    If it meant being by your side.</p>

    <p>I want to say I love you, without saying I love you.<br>
    How can something so beautiful<br>
    Feel like it’s tearing me apart?<br>
    Maybe I’m a coward—<br>
    Maybe I’m scared<br>
    It might actually work.<br>
    But I’d rather have some of you<br>
    Than none of you,<br>
    Even if it means breaking myself<br>
    To keep you whole.</p>
