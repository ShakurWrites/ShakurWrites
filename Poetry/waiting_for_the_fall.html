    <h1>Waiting for the Fall</h1>

    <p>Woke up today and I felt 'nothing.'<br>
    There's no weight on my shoulders,<br>
    No constant feeling of dread.<br>
    There's no panic or anticipation—<br>
    The same ones I've felt for days,<br>
    Every day when I wake up.<br>
    It's supposed to be a relief,<br>
    But I don't trust it.</p>

    <p>Because I've spent weeks in a tunnel,<br>
    Waiting for that bad news.<br>
    And just when the load overpowers me,<br>
    Just when I am exhausted from waiting,<br>
    I wake up—<br>
    feeling nothing.</p>

    <p>Is it the calm before the storm?<br>
    Or the light at the end of a tunnel?<br>
    Or maybe—<br>
    the light at the end of life?</p>

    <p>So I listen harder, waiting,<br>
    Because calm never comes without a price.<br>
    And I don’t know if it’s better to brace myself—<br>
    Or let it take me by surprise.</p>

    <p>Or maybe,<br>
    I should embrace peace<br>
    And not mention its past betrayals.<br>
    Maybe today is the day the other shoe drops,<br>
    Or maybe it already has—<br>
    And I just haven't noticed yet.</p>
