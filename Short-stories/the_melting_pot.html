    <title>THE MELTING POT</title>

<body>

    <p>Malika locked his cart with a chain link, ready to head home. Today had been a good day. He had spent hours carrying luggage for pedestrians, earning anywhere between fifty and a hundred shillings per trip, depending on the distance and the weight. By evening, he had managed to make seven hundred shillings—enough to get by, at least for now. His torn, sweat-drenched T-shirt clung to his back, a testament to the long, exhausting day.
 At least today I won’t sleep with an empty stomach.”  He thought as made his way to the bus stop, bumping shoulders with the crowd of people all going home after a long day of looking for something to put on the table. He made a right onto Tom Mboya Street, a visible bump in his stride.
 "We mzee, angalia mbele!" He shouted as a motorbike narrowly missed him.
“Damn it! I have to buy Mom’s blood pressure medicine!”
The thought hit him like a punch to the gut. His stomach twisted—not from hunger, but from guilt. His mother hadn’t taken her medication in four days, and the signs were already showing. Her blood pressure was creeping up again, attacking her body bit by bit. He knew what he had to do.
But buying the medicine meant one thing—another night of going to bed hungry.
He crossed the road and stepped into a wholesale chemist, where the medicine was slightly cheaper. A short queue had formed, and the three counters were already busy with customers. As he waited, he caught a glance from a man in a freshly pressed suit—a quick up-and-down look, followed by a smirk. The kind that didn’t need words to say, ‘Out of the way, peasant.’
Malika swallowed hard and gripped the right sleeve of his torn T-shirt, instinctively trying to hide it.
“Next!”
He was startled from his thoughts by the pharmacist’s voice.
“Hi, can I get Bi-preterax 5/1.25?”
“Give me a second to check the system.”
A short pause. Then the pharmacist nodded. “Yes, we have it.”
“How much per tablet?”
“Seventy shillings.”
Malika quickly did the math in his head. Seven tablets would have to do.
He handed over a five hundred shilling note and received a ten shilling coin in change. He slipped it into his pocket, already thinking about how carefully he’d need to spend the remaining two hundred shillings. He still had to buy a small portion of maize flour, half a litre of cooking oil, and some milk—just enough to make supper for his mother.
He made his way to the bus stop and boarded a thirty-three-seater matatu. The conductor tapped the metal railing impatiently, signaling for the fare: Fifty shillings, another cut from his dwindling money. Malika sighed, his mind already working through the numbers again. Every coin had to stretch—there was no room for mistakes.
The matatu was a sensory overload—large screens mounted on every side, each with speakers blaring deafening dancehall music. Laser lights darted across the dim interior, turning the ride home into something between a moving disco and a fever dream. The bass was so heavy it rattled in his chest.
But to Malika, it all felt distant, like background noise in a world he wasn’t part of. His mind was elsewhere, tangled in the weight of his thoughts. A lump formed in his throat, and he bit his lip to keep himself from breaking down.
‘What am I supposed to do with my life?”
After an agonizing thirty minutes inside the blaring, neon-lit matatu—made only slightly bearable by the light evening traffic—it finally came to a stop. Malika stepped out, the sudden quiet of the evening a stark contrast to the deafening ride.
He didn’t linger. He headed straight home—a small, single-room structure made of iron sheets, nestled among others just like it. The air was thick with the familiar scent of damp earth and cooking smoke. Turning off the main road, he took a left, then carefully hopped over a sewage drain, the dark water below rippling from his movement.
He stopped by a small kiosk, carefully selecting the bare essentials. Half a liter of cooking oil—fifty shillings. Measured milk—forty shillings. A small portion of maize flour—fifty shillings. Finally, a single cigarette—ten shillings.
As he tucked the items into a plastic bag, he did the math once more. Fifty shillings left. Just enough for bus fare to work tomorrow. Nothing extra. Nothing for lunch. Nothing for emergencies.
He sighed, shoving the change into his pocket before continuing home.
His mother was already asleep when he got home, her frail form barely visible beneath the thin blanket. Malika moved quietly, placing the shopping in the corner of the room that served as their kitchen.
He rinsed an aluminum pot, filled it with water from a jerrican, and turned on the small stove. The soft hiss of the flame was the only sound in the otherwise silent room as he waited for the water to boil, preparing to make ugali.
Stepping outside, Malika lit his cigarette and took a long, slow drag, letting the smoke fill his lungs before exhaling into the cool night air. A single tear escaped, tracing a warm path down his cheek. He wiped it away quickly as if denying it had ever been there.
After a few minutes of uneasy silence, lost in thoughts he couldn’t escape, Malika flicked the cigarette to the ground and stepped back inside. The water was already boiling.
He lifted the lid, added a pinch of salt, and slowly poured in the maize flour, stirring vigorously to break up the lumps. His arm ached, but he kept at it until the mixture thickened. After a few more minutes of stirring and mashing, he covered the pot and let the ugali cook through.
There was only enough for one person. With a quiet sigh, he rinsed a single plate, scooped the ugali onto it, and poured some milk on the side, adding a little sugar for taste. No meat, no vegetables—just another meal to keep his mother going.
“Mom, wake up. Supper is ready." Malika gently tapped his mother’s shoulder.
She stirred slightly but didn’t respond. The dim light cast soft shadows on her face, highlighting the deep lines of exhaustion and age. He tapped her again, a little firmer this time. 
“Mom?” His voice wavered.
She slowly turned and sat up, shielding her eyes from the flickering light. Her movements were sluggish, weighed down by exhaustion and days without proper medication.
Malika watched as her frail hands trembled slightly—scrawny and bony, with large veins snaking across them like a jagged map
She looked at the single plate, then up at her son, her tired eyes filled with quiet concern.
"Son, come, let’s eat together. You’ve been up and down in the sun all day. You need to eat something."
Malika forced a smile, shaking his head. "No, Mom. I already ate an hour ago. You need to eat so you can take your medication."
Just then, his stomach let out a loud, aching growl. He clenched his jaw, pretending not to hear it, but his mother did. She sighed, looking at him with a knowing sadness.
After a few minutes of gentle dispute, his mother’s persistence wore him down. Finally, Malika relented—they would eat together.
He dimmed the kerosene lamp until its light barely flickered, then washed his hands and sat down next to her. He made a show of gently bumping his hands to hers in the plate, pretending to eat, but it was just a disguise. A way to make her feel better, to reassure her that he was taking care of himself, even though his stomach continued to rumble.
His mother ate in silence, her slow, deliberate movements betraying the weariness in her body. As soon as she finished, Malika stood up and brought her a glass of water, then carefully handed her the medication.
She took the pills, then looked at him with tired, grateful eyes. "Thank you, son."
She offered a silent prayer to God, her voice a whisper only the universe could hear. "Bless my son, that he may never lack anything in life."
He kissed his mother goodnight as she drifted back to sleep, her breathing steady and calm. After changing into his sleeping shorts and T-shirt, Malika stepped outside and made his way to the shared bathroom, a small structure made of concrete and iron sheets that served several homes in the area. The cold water ran down his back as he stood under the stream, but it did little to numb the ache inside.
In that moment, everything crashed down on him—his tiredness, his frustration, the endless struggle. The tears came uncontrollably, a burst of sobs that shook his entire body. He pressed his hands against the cool iron sheets, trying to steady himself, but the weight of it all was too much.
"I am tired of living like this!" he shouted into the empty night. "Tired of scraping and fighting just to get by!"
He clenched his fists, the cold water splashing around him unnoticed. "What has my Bachelor's degree helped me with? Nothing!" He let out a bitter laugh, almost choking on the words. "While politicians secure positions with their fake and forged certificates, mine—my first-class honors—just gathers dust!"
His breath came in ragged gasps, "I have to do something."
He stepped out of the bathroom, his heart still racing. He headed back to the house, moving on autopilot, until he reached the corner where he had hidden his most prized possession—his Bachelor’s degree.
He found it under his mattress, ‘Bachelor Degree in Finance-First Class Honors’ along with his other academic certificates, stacked neatly but gathering dust. Beside them lay the makeshift noose, the torn jeans that had almost become an escape. He briefly looked at it, then at his mother, still sleeping in the corner of the room.
"One day, but not today, noose. Not today."
He crumpled the certificates in his hands, the papers folding under the pressure of his grip. He took a matchbox from the table, his hands trembling, and went outside as he struck a match.
One by one, he lit the certificates on fire. Each spark, each flickering flame, seemed to tear something deeper inside him. Tears rolled down his cheeks as the paper curled and burned, disappearing into the smoke, just like his dreams.
Malika then stumbled back to his bed. He curled up under the thin blanket, his chest still tight with the weight of everything he had just destroyed. In the silence of the room, he cried himself to sleep, his tears soaking into the pillow.
Morning came too quickly. The shrill sound of the burner’s alarm pulled him from his restless sleep. His eyes snapped open, and for a moment, he felt disoriented. His mother was already up—he could hear her footsteps outside, probably doing her daily rounds of greeting the neighbors, walking aimlessly to pass the time.
He rubbed his eyes, quickly washed his face, and brushed his teeth, trying to shake off the remnants of the night. Then he changed into a fresh pair of trousers and a T-shirt that barely held together but somehow still looked new. He didn’t have time to think about anything else. He paused in front of a small hand mirror, studying his reflection closely. He ran his fingers through his disheveled hair, trying to tame it just a little, then brushed his beard, though it still looked scruffy and worn. He needed a fresh haircut, no doubt, but the thought quickly faded as he shifted his focus back to the more pressing matters in his life.
There was no time for things like grooming when survival, for both him and his mother, hung in the balance. His eyes were puffy and red. Exhaustion was etched into every line of his face, but he couldn’t afford to give up now. Not when his mother was depending on him.
His mind flicked back to when he was ten—when his father had abandoned them without warning. Back then, his mother had been strong and full of ambition. She worked tirelessly to make sure he finished his studies, sacrificing everything to give him a chance at a better life. And now, it was his turn to return the favor, to be the one to provide.
He grabbed his bag, forced himself to take one last look at the small room that had been his prison and his home, and headed out to work. 
By nine in the morning, Malika reached the city center and made his way straight to his cart, still chained up and waiting. He looked around, aimlessly hoping for a customer, for a job, for anything that might offer a little relief from the endless cycle of struggle.
Then, an elderly man stepped off a matatu, carrying two heavy sacks and a large suitcase. The man approached Malika with a tired look on his face.
"Hey, how much to Afya Centre?"
"Two hundred shillings, mzee."
The man raised an eyebrow, shaking his head. "Naah, that's too much. Make it one hundred."
Malika thought for a moment, weighing the offer. He didn’t have the luxury of being picky, but he also couldn’t afford to undervalue his work.
"Make it one hundred and twenty," he said finally.
The man agreed without much hesitation, and Malika carefully began to load the heavy luggage onto his cart. The journey to Afya Centre took longer than expected. Malika's stomach growled with emptiness—he hadn’t eaten in over twenty-four hours, and the strain of pushing the heavy cart was wearing him down. The bustling crowd made everything worse; people jostled past him, rushing to get on buses or navigate through the busy streets, and the constant flow of public transport slowed him even further. Each step felt like an uphill battle. 
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Malika reached Afya Centre. His arms ached from the strain. The elderly man nodded in appreciation as Malika handed him his bags, then handed over the money.
"Thank you," 
“You are welcome,” Malika said, trying to catch his breath.
He counted the money in his hand—one hundred and twenty shillings. It was enough to keep him going for another day. 
He then made his way back to where he kept his cart, hoping to find another customer along the way. The streets were still crowded, but his energy was running low.
When he reached the usual spot, he spotted a lady selling hot tea and mandazis, doing her daily rounds as she called out to passersby. Malika approached her, his stomach growling louder now.
"One cup of tea and four mandazis, please.”
The lady smiled kindly, handing him a steaming cup of tea and a plate of freshly fried mandazis.
Finally, something to eat. He took a deep breath, savoring the warmth that filled his hands and the hope that, for a brief moment, he wouldn’t have to worry about where his next meal would come from.
Just as Malika took his last sip of tea, a loud bang echoed through the street, followed by the crack of a whip. He turned around in shock, his heart sinking as he saw a group of city council officers moving swiftly through the crowd, confiscating all the carts in sight. The owners, including the lady selling tea, were being arrested.
Malika’s stomach twisted in panic. He jumped to his feet, his breakfast forgotten. His only means of earning a living, his cart, was being taken away. He quickly crossed the road, ducking into a corner to hide, his eyes wide with disbelief.
He watched in helpless dismay as the officers loaded up his cart, his only source of income and the only thing that kept him going, disappearing into the back of their van.
It’s gone. It’s all gone.
He stood there, frozen, as his world crumbled once more.
Once Malika accepted there was nothing more he could do, he aimlessly wandered the city streets, his mind blank and heavy. He had no plan, no idea where to turn next, no clue how he was going to get something—anything—to sustain him and his mother.
As he walked, his steps mechanical, his eyes glazed over, he noticed a lady sitting in a matatu. She was absorbed in her phone, the window cracked open just enough for a breeze to slip through. Something inside him snapped. The desperation, the weight of his failures, the crushing realization that his hard work had amounted to nothing—it all boiled over in an instant.
Without thinking, he started trailing the matatu, his feet moving faster, the pounding in his chest matching the rhythm of his steps.
With one swift motion, he reached into the matatu, snatched the phone from the lady’s hands, and bolted in the opposite direction, his heart racing.
"Mwizi! Mwizi!"
The screams of onlookers filled the air. Within seconds, a mob of irate men, bored and idling, began to chase after him. They shouted, jostling to catch up with him as he sprinted, the phone now a symbol of his desperation and broken resolve. The world around him blurred as he ran, and all he could think was: I need to survive. I need to get away.
Malika turned a corner, his legs burning as he leaped over a fruit vendor’s stand, his heart pounding. He crossed the road in one frantic, desperate motion, feeling like he was almost free. For a brief moment, there was silence—the deafening chaos of pursuit fell away. He thought he had made it.
But in that split second of relief, a large rock struck him on his left temple. The impact sent him stumbling to the ground, disoriented. Before he could gather himself, the angry mob descended on him.
They were upon him in seconds, kicking him in the stomach, and hurling rocks at his head. His broken jaw mumbled a prayer, a weak plea to God, but his words were lost in the frenzy. Blood poured from his wounds, and every inch of his body screamed in pain.
“Please don’t kill me!”
The words escaped his cracked lips, but they were drowned out by the fury of the mob. One man grabbed a tire, threw it over Malika’s head, and tightened it around his neck. Another man poured kerosene on him, the liquid splashing across his skin, making the terror feel more real, more suffocating.
He was bleeding profusely now, his body broken, but it didn’t matter. He was at their mercy.
Just as one of the men raised a match, ready to ignite the kerosene and end it all, a sharp crack split the air. Shots rang out, fired into the sky. The sound was deafening, and the mob froze, scattering in a frenzy like roaches fleeing light.
Malika, gasping for breath, tried to lift his head, his vision blurry through the pain and the blood. Through the chaos, the police officers arrived—like angels, as far as he was concerned. The sight of them, uniforms glinting in the harsh light of the street, washed over him with a wave of relief.
His body still trembled from the pain, but the overwhelming fear and desperation began to melt away. The mob had retreated, and for the first time in what felt like forever, he was no longer the prey. The officers moved swiftly, pulling the remaining attackers away, and Malika could only lie there, his body battered, but alive.
Tired from exhaustion, pain, and panic, Malika's consciousness slipped away. The world went dark.
When he woke up, he was in a sterile, cold room. The harsh scent of disinfectant filled his nostrils. His body felt foreign—his leg was raised, encased in plaster, and his jaw was bound tight with braces, unable to move. A tube was feeding him. The cold, mechanical process of life was returning to him without his consent.
His hands were cuffed to the bed railing, his arms immobilized. A police officer stood just outside the door, guarding him like a prisoner.
He slowly turned his head to look at the ceiling, the fluorescent lights buzzing above him, flickering occasionally. His throat ached, but he couldn’t find the words.
"I'm sorry, Mom."</p>
