        Gilded Chains

        Rebecca tugged at the hem of her skirt without realizing it, trying to make it longer. She had never worn one this short before. The sleek, glass-walled lobby surrounded her, its cold professionalism only adding to her unease. This was her seventh interview this week, and exhaustion weighed heavy on her shoulders. 
        Several other candidates waited in the lobby with her. Rebecca couldn’t help but steal glances at one woman whose skirt was so short it looked more suited for a night out than a job interview. This made her second-guess her outfit. Maybe her knee-length skirt was too modest for the occasion. Every interview she had attended this week had ended in disappointment. Two male interviewers had made offhand comments about her looks. Three had subtly hinted that her skirt should have been shorter. And two hadn’t bothered with pretense—they had outright told her she’d have to offer herself up in exchange for a position.
        If only she had known how hard it would be to secure a job right after campus. She had graduated top of her class with first-class honors, yet she still couldn’t find a place in the corporate world.
        The woman in the short skirt was called in. Rebecca was next. Her stomach twisted into knots, and a wave of cold sweat formed on her forehead. She couldn’t stop fidgeting. She grabbed a newspaper from the glass coffee table, hoping to distract herself. An article on the front page caught her eye. A grisly photo showed a man covered in blood and what appeared to be kerosene, with a tire hanging around his neck. He lay on the ground, surrounded by two police officers who seemed to be shielding him from an enraged mob.
        "Man Rescued by Police After Angry Mob Attacks Him for Stealing a Cellphone from a Matatu."
        The article began. Rebecca's knees stopped shaking as she focused on the story, momentarily forgetting her anxiety. The woman in the short skirt emerged from the office, a satisfied smile on her face as she also tugged at the hem of her skirt.
        “Next.”
        Rebecca was jolted from her thoughts. She set the newspaper down, gathered her documents, and walked toward the office. Knocking once, she slowly turned the handle and stepped inside.
        The sight took her off guard. The office was nothing short of luxurious. A high, double-volume ceiling allowed air to circulate freely, while the walls were adorned with expensive paintings. Floor-to-ceiling windows framed a breathtaking view of Nairobi’s skyline.
        At the far end of the room, a man sat with his back to the entrance, gazing out at the city below.
        "Have a seat."
        A deep voice resonated as the man swiveled his chair to face Rebecca.
        "Did you know that the population of women is nearly double that of men? And that the boy child is being neglected, all thanks to this so-called 'women empowerment'?"
        Rebecca blinked, caught off guard by the unexpected statement. She had no idea how to respond.
        The man was well-built and fit, with a neatly trimmed beard that connected fully. His deep-set hazel-brown eyes held an intensity that was hard to ignore, and his fair complexion gave him a striking appearance. He looked more like a model than a manager at one of the country's leading audit firms.
        After an uneasy silence, the man finally spoke. "So, tell me about yourself."
        Rebecca took a deep breath, crossed her legs, and began.
        "Well, my name is Rebecca Natasha. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Commerce, Finance option, with first-class honors, and I’m currently pursuing my Certified Professional Accountant certification. I previously worked as an Accounts Assistant Intern at the Kenya Wildlife Service, which gave me valuable insights into the field of accounting and finance. I aspire to reach the pinnacle of the finance and accounting world and advance my career in this industry.”
        The man nodded, seemingly impressed. Rebecca’s confidence and eloquence spoke volumes about her.
        "Why should we hire you? What do you bring to the Accounts Assistant position?"
        Rebecca straightened slightly. "I believe I am the best candidate for this job because my strong academic background, combined with the experience I gained during my internship, sets me apart from other applicants. I am a team player, highly adaptable, and able to work efficiently with minimal supervision.”
        "Could you please stand up for me?"
        Rebecca froze, caught off guard by the request. She hesitated, then slowly placed her documents on the mahogany table and rose to her feet, instinctively tugging at the hem of her skirt.
        "Turn around. Slowly."
        The man's gaze remained fixed on her, unblinking.
        "But, sir—"
        "I said, turn around. Slowly.”
        Rebecca reluctantly began to turn, her movements stiff. As she caught her reflection in the glass window, a wave of discomfort washed over her. “What am I doing?”
        Her blazer and blouse suddenly felt tighter around her chest, and she instinctively fastened the top button. The skirt wasn’t helping either. She had thought it would—after all, many of her classmates who landed jobs in big firms had assured her that dressing this way made a difference.
        The man’s gaze roamed over her body, slow and deliberate—like a predator sizing up its prey. His eyes flicked from hers to her lips, then down to her chest.
        "She’s certainly blessed," he mused to himself.
        "What did you say your name was again?"
        Rebecca's face burned. ‘Now he’s just playing with me.’
        "Re… Rebecca Natasha, sir," she managed to say.
        The man typed something on his computer, and moments later, the printer whirred to life. As it processed the document, he kept his eyes on her, unblinking.
        Rebecca couldn’t hold his gaze. She dropped her eyes to her legs instead, shifting uncomfortably. She wanted this job—she needed it. But more than anything, she just wanted this interview to be over.
        The man suddenly stood up, and Rebecca flinched. Her heart pounded. She didn’t know what to expect.
        ‘Oh my God, it’s coming.’
        But instead, he stretched out his hand toward her.
        "Congratulations. Welcome to Joseph, Jacob, and Jonah Holdings Limited."
        Rebecca hesitated before slowly extending her hand. As they shook, his grip lingered longer than necessary. A chill ran down her spine.
        The printer fell silent once more. The man picked up the freshly printed documents and handed them to Rebecca.
        "Go through these, then sign here and here," he said, pointing at the designated spots.
        The rest of the interview was a blur. Rebecca skimmed through the documents hastily, the dense legal jargon making some clauses difficult to grasp—but she didn’t care. She had a job now. She needed this job.
        Without a second thought, she signed on the designated spots and handed the papers back to the man.
        "You'll start on Monday," he said. "You'll be stationed on the first floor in the office of one of the accountants. You'll report to him, and he will report to me.”
        "Thank you so much for this opportunity, sir. I promise I'll give my best."
        "Close the door on your way out, please."
        There was something about him that unsettled Rebecca—his attitude, his ego.
        She stepped out, shutting the door behind her, then headed straight for the washrooms. Once inside, she turned on the tap, splashed cold water on her face, and took deep, steadying breaths.
        She looked at her reflection, locking eyes with herself. Her breathing had just started to steady when a crushing realization hit her—she had forgotten her documents in the man's office.
        Her stomach dropped. “Do I really have to go back in there?”
        She knew she had to go back, even though every part of her resisted. She had no choice. Summoning her courage, she walked back to the office and knocked twice. Silence.
        After a brief hesitation, she turned the handle and pushed the door open.
        The man was standing directly behind it, her bag in one hand. His presence so close startled her.
        "I believe you forgot this," he said, a faint smirk on his lips.
        Rebecca wasn’t even sure how it happened—one moment, the bag was in his hand, and the next, it was in hers. Without a word, she turned and hurried out, her heart pounding in her chest.
        The week flew by as Rebecca busied herself preparing for her new job—buying new clothes, visiting the salon, and ensuring all her documents were in order.
        On Monday morning, she arrived precisely at eight. A secretary from her department greeted her and promptly took her on a tour of the office, showing her around and explaining the basics of her new workplace. She still couldn't believe it—she had finally secured a job. Her dream job. It felt surreal at first, and she couldn't stop herself from smiling.
        But somewhere in the back of her mind, the thought of the man who interviewed her lingered. A shadow she couldn’t quite shake. At least she hadn’t been placed in his department. That was a relief. 
        Her first week went by smoothly. She was assigned small tasks to help her get up to speed and familiarize herself with the company’s culture.
        The head accountant, whom she reported to, seemed like a good man—soft-spoken and reserved, only speaking to her when necessary. He was professional, and accommodating, and made sure she felt comfortable. Still, Rebecca reminded herself not to let her guard down.
        Then, on the second day of her second week, the utopia began to lose its veneer.
        "Are you married?" one of her male colleagues asked casually.
        "No," Rebecca replied.
        "So, you're single?"
        "No, I’m seeing someone."
        The man chuckled. "Well, I don’t see a ring, and as long as you’re not married, you’re single."
        Rebecca's brows furrowed, her face heating up with irritation. She didn’t bother responding—she just turned and walked away. She hurried back to her desk and sat there, staring blankly at her screen.
        "What’s wrong with some men?" she thought, frustration bubbling inside her. "They see me as an object—something to fulfill their desires, not a human being with feelings. You’d think they don’t have mothers or sisters."
        Her hands clenched into fists on her lap. She had worked so hard to get here, yet it seemed like she would have to fight just to be treated with respect.
        "Rebecca, could you please take these documents to Joseph? I need him to sign them." Kioko's voice jolted her from her thoughts.
        "Joseph?"
        "Oh yeah, the one who interviewed you."
        Her heart sank. Of all people…
        Going to his office was the last thing she wanted. But she couldn’t refuse either. Without a word, she took the documents and made her way to his office, her grip tightening around the papers. 
        The elevators were under maintenance, so Rebecca had no choice but to take the stairs. She climbed slowly, one step at a time, as if delaying the inevitable. The thought of facing Joseph again made her uneasy, and for once, she didn’t mind the tiring ascent to the sixth floor. If anything, she wished the building had more floors.
        She reached his office and paused outside the door, taking a deep breath to steady herself. After a few moments, she finally summoned the courage and knocked.
        "Come in."
        Just the sound of his voice made her uneasy. Slowly, she pushed the door open and stepped inside. Joseph was buried in paperwork, barely looking up as she entered. But as soon as she did, he spoke.
        "Could you lock the door, please? I don’t want any disturbances.”
        Rebecca hesitated but did as she was told. Then, a strange thought hit her. ‘No.’ Subtly, she turned the key again, unlocking the door.
        "Thank you."
        Rebecca nodded and walked toward his desk.
        "Mr. Kioko asked me to bring these. He needs you to sign them," she said, placing the documents in front of him.
        Joseph took them and began flipping through the pages, reading at an agonizingly slow pace.
        Rebecca shifted uncomfortably, unsure of what to do. So she just stood there, waiting.
        After signing the documents, Joseph set them aside and stood up. He walked to the window, gazing outside for a moment before turning back. His eyes locked onto Rebecca as he started walking toward her.
        Instinctively, she took a step back. Then another. Without knowing, her back hit the wall.
        Joseph kept closing the distance until he was mere inches from her. He smiled—that kind of smile—then reached out, taking her hand in his. 
        Rebecca’s heart pounded in her chest. Her breath caught in her throat. She then instinctively pulled his hand off hers.
        "Mmh, a challenge. I love challenges."
        She pressed her lips together, resisting the urge to gag—he reeked of garlic and onion. But Joseph didn’t seem to care.
        Before she could react, he moved swiftly, gripping her waist with one hand and placing the other on her neck. Then, without warning, he leaned in—forcefully—going for a kiss.
        Rebecca had only one choice. Without warning, she summoned all the strength she could muster and drove her knee straight into his crotch.
        Joseph let out a strangled gasp, immediately doubling over in pain. He clutched himself and collapsed onto the floor, his face twisted in agony.
        "You f—fucking bitch!" he wheezed.
        Rebecca didn’t wait to hear more. She flung the door open and bolted out. She wasn’t even sure how she made it back to her desk so fast. Her hands trembled. Her chest heaved. Tears burned at the edges of her eyes, but she refused to let them fall.
        Mr. Kioko was in the middle of a call when she burst into the office. He raised an eyebrow but quickly wrapped up his conversation.
        "Can you give me a few minutes? I'll call you back.”. Then, turning to Rebecca, he asked, "Is everything okay?"
        She forced a smile. "Yes, yes, it is. I just feel a little lightheaded and drained. I thought I’d sit down for a bit."
        "Oh, take your time. Let me know if you need anything," Mr. Kioko said before returning to his call.
        Rebecca nodded, trying to steady herself. A few minutes later, a knock on the door made her heart jolt. Then she saw him.
        Joseph. All smiles.
        Her body went rigid with fear and anger as he casually walked in as if nothing had happened.
        "Oh, Mr. Kioko, how are you?" he greeted cheerfully.
        "I'm fine. And you? I see you’ve decided to visit us today," Mr. Kioko replied, standing up to shake his hand.
        "Yes, got tired of the boredom and solitude up there," Joseph chuckled.
        Then he turned to Rebecca and stretched out his hand.
        Rebecca hesitated. Every fiber of her being screamed at her not to touch him. But then Mr. Kioko looked at her expectantly. She had no choice. Reluctantly, she reached out and shook Joseph’s hand—just for a second—before pulling away.
        The two men went on, raving about nothing in particular. Football. Family. End-year parties.
        Rebecca sat there, silent, her mind spinning, her hands clenched into fists under the desk. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Joseph left. The moment the door shut behind him, Rebecca let out a shaky breath—only then realizing she had been holding it. Her vision blurred for a second, and for the first time, she actually felt lightheaded.
        "Uh, Rebecca, where are the documents?"
        Rebecca’s stomach dropped.
        "Fuck!" she muttered under her breath. She had forgotten them in Joseph’s office.
        "I left them with Joseph," she said quickly. "He said he’d go through them before signing."
        Mr. Kioko nodded. "Well, I need them now, so please go back for them.”
        Rebecca took the elevator this time, her pulse quickening with every floor. When she reached the sixth, she strode straight to Joseph’s office and pushed the door open without knocking. She then left it wide open.
        Without sparing him a glance, she marched to his desk, grabbed the documents, and turned on her heels. Not a word. Not a pause. She was out the door before he could even react. 
        After handing the documents to Mr. Kioko, Rebecca walked straight to the washrooms. The moment she locked the door behind her, the weight of everything crashed down. Tears spilled down her cheeks, hot and uncontrollable. She tried to stifle her sobs, but the more she held back, the harder they came. Her body trembled as she gripped the sink, staring at her reflection through blurry eyes. She felt disgusted. Powerless. Angry. And worst of all—trapped.
        She then wiped her tears, splashed cold water on her face, and forced herself to return to her desk.
        She had no energy left for anything productive, so she just doodled absently, staring blankly at the desktop.
        The hours dragged on.
        Finally, the clock hit five. She grabbed her bag and bolted outside, desperate to leave. But just as she reached the stairs, she bumped into Joseph. Her stomach twisted.
        She moved as far to the side of the wall as possible, trying to pass without incident.
        Then—SMACK.
        A sharp, stinging pain shot through her as Joseph hit her hard on the butt.
        He chuckled, giggling to himself as he ascended the stairs, as if it was all just a joke.
        Rebecca froze. Her breath hitched. That was it. She could not survive one more day in this place.
        That night, Rebecca cried herself to sleep. By morning, she knew exactly what she had to do. The first thing she did was write her resignation letter. She didn’t care about the job anymore—it was a matter of survival.
        To make sure the company didn’t try to trap her in bureaucratic nonsense, she added a firm paragraph:
        She had been sexually assaulted.
        If they tried anything, she would sue.
        With that done, she exhaled deeply, as if a weight had lifted—but the emptiness that followed was unexpected. For months, she had fought to earn her place in the corporate world, only to walk away barely two weeks in. All that effort, all those sleepless nights, and yet... here she was.
        Still, she knew this was the right choice. The alternative was unthinkable. She cleaned her house, put on her favorite music, and let herself breathe. There was a strange sense of peace in knowing she wouldn’t have to walk into that building again. But as she sat on the couch, staring at the ceiling, an unsettling thought crept in.
        What now?
        "This isn’t the end," she whispered to herself, as much to push away the doubt as to reassure herself.
        “I know big things are coming for me.”
