        THE INEVITABLE VISITOR

        Duncan stood on the curb, waiting for the light to change. The city buzzed around him, the usual sounds of traffic and conversation blending into the background of his life. He checked his watch—same time as usual.
        The bus screeched to a halt, and he stepped forward, feeling the sharp chill of the morning air cut through his jacket. But just as he was about to board, he froze. The feeling hit him again—something wasn’t right. A brief flash of déjà vu, a whisper of something from the past.
        He shook it off, telling himself it was nothing.
        Then a car swerved into the crosswalk.
        Before Duncan could react, the headlights blinded him, and the screeching of tires filled the air. Everything went black.

        Duncan jolted awake, the five-thirty morning alarm blaring in his ears. “Fuck,” he muttered, slapping the alarm clock to snooze it, but something was off. A feeling of unease crept in as he lay back, staring at the ceiling. He shook it off, but the thought lingered. He rubbed his eyes, pushing himself out of bed and heading for the bathroom. The familiar routine of the morning seemed so... routine. Yet, it didn’t feel like his own. As he brushed his teeth, staring at his reflection in the mirror, he couldn’t shake the nagging sense of déjà vu, like he’d been here before—doing this, exactly this, only moments ago. He finished brushing and turned to get dressed. Clothes were scattered across the floor, piles of dirty and clean mixed together in a chaotic mess. He picked out a pink shirt, sniffed it, and tossed it aside. “Naah, too dirty.” Another shirt. Another sniff test. He finally settled on a sky-blue shirt and navy khaki pants that looked like a cow had chewed them. As he tugged the shirt over his head, he noticed how tight it pulled across his belly. His once-chiseled abs had been replaced by a soft, protruding stomach, and the love handles at his sides dug into the fabric. What happened to me? The thought came unbidden, sharp with self-loathing.
        He then made his way to the kitchen. The sink was a mess—dirty utensils piled up in a disorganized heap. As he passed the counter, a framed photograph caught his eye. It showed his ex-wife smiling gently, her arm around their ten-year-old son, who grinned back at the camera. For a moment, the sight of them paused his steps—an echo of a life that once was. Shaking off the bittersweet pang, he continued toward the fridge. Opening it, he was met with spoiled vegetables and nothing else that could be eaten. With a frustrated sigh, he closed his eyes and left the house, locking the door behind him.
        He took two stairs at a time as he descended, eager to get out of the apartment. It was a ten-minute walk to the bus stop. The city was slowly waking up, and the streets were already filled with people—each one moving like a cog in the relentless machine of the day, ready to attack it, like they always did. The traffic lights turned red just as he reached the curb. He checked his watch—same time as usual. This isn't right. The same unsettling feeling hit him again, a flicker of something familiar, but off. Just for a moment, he hesitated. A lady beside him spilled her morning coffee as she bumped into another man. The collision was casual, the sort of minor inconvenience that happened every morning. But to Duncan, it all felt strangely familiar, like he had seen it play out a hundred times before.
        The lights turned green, but Duncan just stood there. He wanted to cross to the other side, but his body wouldn’t move. Something was holding him back—something in his chest, like a weight.
        As he stood frozen, lost in thought, a car suddenly swerved into the crosswalk, narrowly missing the lady who had spilled her coffee just moments before. The screeching tires sent pedestrians scattering, and a couple of them yelled in alarm. A traffic cop quickly stepped into the road, stopping the car.
        Duncan stood there, his heart pounding. He felt relief, but it was quickly overshadowed by the shock of it all.
        “Hey! Move along!”
        Duncan was startled out of his thoughts by a man’s voice. He quickly crossed the road, barely noticing the cars speeding past, and made it to the other side, safe and sound.
        “Beba, beba, town 50!”
        The usual touts called to pedestrians, urging them to board their buses.
        He boarded the bus and waited for a few minutes as it slowly filled up. Soft, old-school R&B music played through the car speakers, the kind that felt like a distant memory. The tout began collecting fares, moving down the aisle with practiced speed. Duncan handed him a one-thousand note without even registering it, his mind still clouded. Was he going mad? To snap himself out of it, he muttered under his breath, “At least I didn’t die.”
        “Hey, tell the driver to drive slowly,” an elderly lady called to the tout.
        Her words immediately caught Duncan's attention. Just as the tout handed him his nine hundred and fifty change, the bus suddenly swerved. The driver had attempted to overtake another car, cutting it too close. Before Duncan could even process what was happening, the bus lurched violently, its wheels screeching against the asphalt.
        The driver struggled to steer back into the lane, but it was too late. With a sickening thud, the bus slammed into a large tipper truck, the impact so brutal that the front end of the bus folded like paper.
        Time seemed to stretch as the world around Duncan warped. He couldn’t react in time. His knees snapped with an agonizing crack as the force of the crash pinned him down. A piece of metal flew through the air, striking his head.
        And then... everything went black.

        The alarm blared. Duncan slapped it off and sat up, staring at the ceiling. Hadn’t I already done this?
        He rubbed his eyes and stumbled to the bathroom. Brushed his teeth. Stared at his reflection for a moment, the same sense of déjà vu gnawing at him. He dressed quickly—sky-blue shirt, khaki pants—too tight, too familiar.
        The kitchen sink was a mess, the fridge empty. Same as before. Duncan grabbed his keys, locked the door, and left.
        He took the stairs two at a time, walked to the bus stop, and reached the crosswalk just as the lights turned red. He checked his watch—same time again.
        Duncan glanced around, his eyes landing on the lady standing next to him. He watched as she moved to step into the same man’s path, just as she had moments before. Without thinking, he stepped between them, blocking the man’s way.
        "Thank you, I didn't notice," she said, startled.
        "You’re welcome," Duncan muttered, his voice distant, as if he were already somewhere else.
        He waited for a few moments after the light turned green. The same car swerved into the crosswalk, narrowly missing the lady, just as it had before.
        Duncan watched the chaos unfold, but something inside him felt numb. The shouts of pedestrians, the honking horns—it all felt distant. He crossed the road without even registering the yells, his mind too clouded with confusion to care.
        At the bus stop, Duncan opted for a fourteen-seater van this time. The van took off immediately since he was the last one to climb in. He handed the tout a one-thousand shilling note, his mind still swirling with confusion.
        Just as he received his nine hundred and fifty change, a sudden thought hit him. He looked out the window, and a bus rushed past them, speeding at an alarming pace. His mind wandered, but a sharp screech of tires jolted him back to reality.
        Bang.
        The sound of the crash echoed in his chest. The van slowed to a crawl, caught in traffic. As they passed the scene, Duncan’s eyes darted to the wreckage. The Farmilia bus had been crushed, its front end twisted and folded like a discarded tin can. Body parts—arms, legs—were strewn across the street, a grisly reminder of the violence of the crash.
        Duncan couldn’t look away.
        He didn’t even know how he reached his workplace. He was lost in thought, his mind still reeling from the crash.
        He sat down at his desk, mechanically turning on his computer. The screen flickered to life, but he didn’t register any of it. He just stared blankly, his hands frozen above the keyboard, unsure of what to do.
        The bank was just opening for the day, the cleaning lady almost done with her rounds, sweeping the last of the dust from the floor. Everything felt like it was happening in slow motion, but Duncan couldn’t find his way into it.
        It was already twelve by the time Duncan realized it. The hours had slipped by unnoticed, lost in a haze. He stepped outside to catch his breath, lighting up a cigarette. He took a long drag, feeling the smoke fill his lungs, then exhaled with a sigh, watching the tendrils of smoke twist into the air.
        As he entered the building, three men walked past him, heading toward the front of the bank. Duncan barely noticed them at first, but as he made his way back to his desk, one of the men shouted, his voice sharp and commanding, “This is a robbery! Everyone lie down!”
        A chill ran down Duncan’s spine as the man brandished an M-16 rifle, his eyes scanning the room.
        Shouts and murmurs erupted, filling the air with panic. People dropped to the floor, scrambling to comply. But Duncan—still distant, still numb—stood frozen for a moment, caught between the chaos and his inability to process what was happening.
        "Now you’ll make me make an example out of you," one of the men growled, his voice menacing as he aimed the rifle at Duncan.
        But Duncan couldn’t process what was happening. His mind was too foggy, too disconnected from the fear and violence unfolding around him.
        Then there was a loud bang—a deafening crack that split the air. A bullet tore through his chest, and he collapsed to the floor with a sickening thud.
        Harrowing screams echoed through the bank, but they sounded like they were coming from somewhere far off, like the noise wasn’t real. Duncan’s vision blurred as he stared up at the fluorescent lights, the cold, sterile glow above him. Blood pooled beneath him as he bled out, his heartbeat slowing with each passing second.
        And then, everything went black.

        Duncan woke up with a strange sense of clarity. The alarm hadn’t gone off yet, but he felt the weight of the day pressing down on him. He sat up slowly, looking around at the mess of his apartment. The clothes scattered across the floor, the dishes piled up in the sink. It all felt... familiar.
        For the first time in days, he got up without the usual rush, without the panic. He grabbed a broom and started sweeping. The motion felt mechanical, like his body was on autopilot, but there was something oddly grounding about it.
        He picked up the dirty plates, washed them one by one, and stacked them neatly. Each little task seemed to take longer than it should, but Duncan didn’t mind. He didn’t care.
        There was no escape from the inevitable. So he cleaned.
        Duncan sat back down on his couch, the cleaning finally done. The apartment looked a little less chaotic, a little more put together, but it wasn’t about the space. It was about him—his mind, his heart. He let out a deep breath and looked around, his eyes landing on the picture of his ex-wife and son. He hadn’t noticed it in so long, but now it seemed to stand out more than anything else in the room. The pain, the regret—everything felt clearer, more defined.
        With a deep breath, he reached for his phone and dialed his lawyer. As the line rang, he realized this was the first time in years he wasn’t putting off the necessary things in his life.
        He made arrangements—tidied up the last pieces of his existence, leaving everything he had left to his estranged wife and son.
        Duncan then dialed his father's number. It was answered after two rings.
        "Hello, son."
        The sound of his father’s voice broke Duncan. Tears welled up in his eyes as he began to narrate everything—the loops, the deaths, the confusion. The weight of it all poured out in the broken words he could hardly manage.
        There was a long pause on the other end of the line.
        Finally, his father spoke "Son, death is what gives life meaning. To know that your days are numbered makes you appreciate life even more."
        Duncan sat back, the tears still flowing, but now with a different weight. He had lived so much of his life without ever truly thinking about death, without understanding how fragile time was.
        He wiped his tears away, taking a deep breath as he stood up. He fetched a piece of paper and a pen from the desk drawer, then sat back down. With a steady hand, he began to write a letter to his ex-wife, pouring out everything he had never said. He spoke of regret, of love lost, but also of gratitude for the time they had shared.
        The letter to his son came next, each word laced with love and hope for the future he wouldn’t be a part of. Duncan’s hand trembled slightly as he wrote, but he forced himself to keep going, wanting his son to know how much he meant to him.
        With both letters finished, Duncan sat back for a moment, rereading them. A sense of calm washed over him—he had said what needed to be said.
        He then picked up his phone, ordering his favorite pizza—chicken pepperoni. A small, comforting indulgence. As the food arrived, he put on his favorite TV show—Game of Thrones. The familiar opening theme filled the room, and for a fleeting moment, everything felt normal.
        He sat back on the couch, the letters beside him, the pizza in front of him, and the show playing in the background. Duncan felt the finality of everything. He didn’t know when, but he knew the end was coming soon. And for the first time, he was at peace with it.
        He then felt a sudden tightening in his chest, sharp and insistent. At first, he thought it was nothing—just indigestion, maybe. But the pressure grew, gnawing at him, spreading down his left arm, gripping his ribs with cold, unrelenting fingers.
        His breath grew shallow, like something heavy was sitting on his chest. He tried to shake it off, but his heart was beating in a frantic, irregular rhythm, thudding too loudly in his ears. The edges of his vision started to darken, and for a moment, the world around him seemed to stretch and slow, as if it were all slipping away from him.
        The pain intensified, a deep, crushing force in his chest, making it harder to breathe, to think. Sweat broke out across his forehead as his pulse hammered in his temples. He reached out instinctively, grabbing the couch arm as if to steady himself, but his body felt like it was betraying him—muscles weakening, the room spinning.
        His mouth went dry, his limbs numb, as if all the blood had been pulled away from his extremities and redirected to the center of his body in a desperate, futile attempt to survive. The pain wasn’t just physical—it was everywhere, inside and out, a crushing weight he couldn’t escape. His heart, once strong and capable, had turned against him, and there was nothing left but the slow, inevitable collapse.
        The TV’s distant voices were like muffled echoes now. Duncan’s gaze drifted to the ceiling, the world fading into darkness as the pressure on his chest reached a breaking point. His pulse stuttered, and for a fleeting second, he thought of his ex-wife, his son—how everything had unraveled. And then, with no more strength to hold on, the world went silent.
